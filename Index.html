    <p>Last Updated: December 26, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Jdeas Software</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Away Timer mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Away Timer is designed to be a private, local-first utility. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers. All playlist data and timer settings are stored locally on your device.</p>
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requires certain permissions (Foreground Service, Wake Lock, Exact Alarm) to ensure the timer functions correctly while your screen is off or you are away from your phone. These are used strictly for app functionality.</p>
